# Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

This document provides an enterprise-grade blueprint for recovering from disasters while maintaining key business operations. It covers backup and restoration workflows, system redundancy, and compliance-driven processes ensuring minimal downtime and data loss.

---

## 1. Introduction

Disaster events can include data center outages, network disruptions, or security breaches. This plan ensures:

• 99.99% uptime, aligning with High Availability requirements referenced in [architecture_docs → high_level_architecture].  
• A 1-hour RPO (Recovery Point Objective) to limit data loss, achieved via frequent backups and cross-region replication.  
• A 4-hour RTO (Recovery Time Objective) to restore full functionality, leveraging automated failover.  
• Adherence to SOC 2, GDPR, and CCPA compliance, specifically for data handling and breach notifications.

The B2B Sales Intelligence Platform’s DR framework references:
• [terraform_config → infrastructure_outputs], consolidating environment endpoints for multi-region coverage.  
• [terraform_config → failover_config], dictating automated failover triggers and cutover steps.  
• [monitoring_docs → incident_response], for standardized severity classifications and escalations.  

---

## 2. DR Architecture and Failover

### 2.1 Multi-Region Strategy

Our multi-region design, per [architecture_docs → high_level_architecture], duplicates core services (Next.js app, Supabase DB, Redis cluster, file storage) in geographically disparate locations:

1. Primary Region (active environment).  
2. Secondary Region (hot standby).  

Real-time replication ensures that if the Primary Region fails, the Secondary Region activates. Key pillars:

• Automated Health Checks: Each component uses heartbeat metrics and [monitoring_docs → monitoring_stack] hooks.  
• Intelligent Failover: [terraform_config → failover_config] triggers Vercel and Supabase to redirect traffic.  
• Zero-Downtime Deployment: Rolling updates across regions avoid disruptions.

### 2.2 System Components Redundancy

• PostgreSQL (Supabase): Multi-zone and cross-region read replica, with continuous WAL archiving.  
• Redis Enterprise: Cluster-mode with 3+ nodes; daily backups stored in a different region.  
• Storage (S3-compatible): Cross-region replication configured; versioning ensures 30 days of historical object retention.  
• Application Layer: Deployed across multiple Vercel edge locations, auto-scaling to keep 99.99% availability.

## 3. disaster_recovery_plan.backup_procedures

### 3.1 Overview of Backup Strategy

This platform incorporates a consistent backup framework and encryption (AES-256-GCM) for data at rest and in transit. RPO is 1 hour thanks to frequent snapshots and near-real-time replication. The approach is shaped by [terraform_config → infrastructure_outputs.backup_configurations] which unify:

• Database backups (Supabase DB)  
• Redis snapshot backups  
• Cross-region S3 versioning  

### 3.2 Procedure Documented via "document_backup_procedures"

We employ an internal function, “document_backup_procedures(component_type, compliance_requirements),” to generate standardized policies. Key steps:

1. Document Automated Scheduling: Hourly snapshots for DB and Redis, daily for full S3 bucket snapshots.  
2. Detail Encryption Requirements: Each snapshot is encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest.  
3. Cross-Region Replication: S3-based artifacts replicate to a secondary region for DR.  
4. Automated Verification: Every 24 hours, sample backups are restored in a sandbox to validate data integrity.  
5. Compliance Validation: Ensures the backups conform to SOC 2, GDPR, and CCPA guidelines.  
6. Retention Policies: The platform enforces a 30-day retention window.  
7. Restoration Testing: Periodic DR drills measure RTO compliance (4 hours).  
8. Health Check Procedures: Monitoring and alerts run each step to confirm success.

### 3.3 Database Backup Details

• Supabase Backups: Using transaction log shipping and daily full snapshots retained 30 days.  
• PITR (Point-In-Time Recovery): Enabled for production. On detection of corruption, revert to the last known good WAL record.  
• Automated Copy to Secondary Region: Leveraging cloud-based asynchronous streaming.

### 3.4 Redis Backup Details

• Snapshot-based backups daily; incremental every 6 hours.  
• Retained in cross-region storage for 30 days.  
• Restoration test monthly, verifying ephemeral data can be rebuilt swiftly.

### 3.5 File Storage Backup

• S3 Versioning + Cross-Region Replication.  
• Lifecycle rules transition older versions to cheaper storage after 14 days, but keep them for 30.  
• Each version is encrypted (AES-256-GCM).  
• Map to [terraform_config → infrastructure_outputs.backup_configurations] for schedules.

### 4.1 Recovery Workflow

Upon major incident or regional failure, the “generate_dr_process_diagram(process_type, process_config)” function provides a detailed flow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Disaster Detected] --> B{Assess Impact}
    B -->|SEV1 or Region-Wide| C[Initiate Failover]
    C --> D[Switch DNS and Vercel Edge to Secondary Region]
    D --> E[Restore DB from Cross-Region Backup if needed]
    E --> F[Redis Warm-Up & Cache Synchronization]
    F --> G[Validate Application Integrity]
    G -->|Success| H[Full Service Online in Secondary Region]
    G -->|Failure| I[Rollback or Retry Steps]
```

Key steps:

• Automated Health Checks: On continuous failures, triggers incident response.  
• Failover Execution: [terraform_config → failover_config] modifies environment routes and database endpoints.  
• Data Validation: Ensure that recovered data meets RPO of 1 hour.  
• Service Reverification: Confirm app, DB, and Redis are consistent.  
• Communication: Activate pre-defined channels in [business_continuity_plan.communication_matrix].

### 4.2 RTO Procedures

To satisfy the 4-hour RTO:

• Infrastructure as Code Rebuild: Vercel deployments and Supabase environment re-provision in ~30 min.  
• Database Restoration: Rolling load of WAL segments plus snapshot, typically <1 hour.  
• DNS Propagation: TTL set to minimal (e.g., 60s) to expedite switch.  
• Verification & Smoke Tests: Automatic run of synthetic transactions confirms system readiness.

### 4.3 Rollback Approach

If failover or partial restore fails:

1. Revert environment changes.  
2. Re-initiate from a known valid snapshot.  
3. Reattempt data synchronization.  
4. Escalate to senior engineering management and execute manual DR steps if automated checks fail repeatedly.

## 5. disaster_recovery_plan.compliance_procedures

### 5.1 Security and Regulatory Overview

All DR measures align with:

• SOC 2: Proper logging, controls, and data retention policies.  
• GDPR & CCPA: Right-to-erasure, breach notifications, and data minimization.  
• AES-256-GCM encryption for backups and in-flight replication.

### 5.2 DR Auditing and Documentation

Audits confirm:

• Backup logs, LTR (long-term retention) for 30 days.  
• Restoration logs, ensuring minimal data exposure.  
• Access control logs, verifying only authorized roles triggered DR.

### 5.3 Testing & Reporting

• Quarterly DR Drills: Evaluate failover times, backup validity, compliance checks.  
• Post-Drill Report: Summarizes RTO, data integrity, user impact.  
• Security Team Review: Identity & Access Management scans for each DR test, ensuring no policy violations.
