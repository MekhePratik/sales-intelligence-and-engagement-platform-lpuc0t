  Feature Request Template
  =============================================================================
  This template enforces a standardized approach for proposing new features,
  capturing vital information such as business value, technical details, and
  success metrics. It addresses the following requirements from our Technical
  Specifications:

  1) Development Workflow (Technical Specs ยง4.5):
     - Ensures feature requests are integrated with the CI/CD pipeline
     - Standardizes the development process for clarity and efficiency

  2) User Requirements (Technical Specs ยง1.2 Success Criteria):
     - Aligns requested features with 80% user adoption objective
     - Maintains focus on reducing prospecting time by 60%
     - Contributes to improved conversion rates and overall ROI

  3) Feature Scope (Technical Specs ยง1.3 Core Features):
     - Validates that requests align with lead management, email automation,
       analytics, and integration capabilities
     - Helps prevent scope creep by explicitly defining in-scope and out-of-scope
       items
