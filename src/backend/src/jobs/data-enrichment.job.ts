/**
 * DataEnrichmentJob
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Advanced job processor class for handling lead data enrichment tasks with
 * comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and performance optimization.
 *
 * It integrates the following responsibilities:
 * 1) Setting up and registering the job processor with the queue service.
 * 2) Processing enrichment tasks by invoking LeadService to:
 *    - Enrich the lead's data using AI (enrichLeadData).
 *    - Recalculate the lead's score after enrichment (recalculateLeadScore).
 * 3) Managing graceful shutdown to allow ongoing jobs to finish.
 *
 * The class relies on:
 * - LeadService for all lead-related operations (e.g., data enrichment, scoring).
 * - QueueService for registering and processing Bull queue tasks.
 * - Logger for structured logging across events.
 * - A maxRetries/backoffDelay scheme for controlled reprocessing or job retry strategies.
 * - isShuttingDown for tracking graceful application or service shutdown states.
