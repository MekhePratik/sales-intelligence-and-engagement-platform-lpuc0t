/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * analytics-rollup.job.ts
 *
 * This file defines two primary exports for handling analytics rollups and scheduling:
 *   1) processAnalyticsRollup: An enhanced job processor function that processes analytics data
 *      aggregations, leveraging improved error handling, distributed tracing, and caching.
 *   2) scheduleRollupJobs: A job scheduler function configuring hourly, daily, and weekly rollups
 *      with health checks, concurrency settings, and graceful shutdown.
 *
 * Requirements Addressed:
 *   - Analytics Core Feature: Campaign performance tracking, conversion analytics, and ROI calculation.
 *   - Success Criteria Tracking: Tracks KPIs including user adoption, lead quality, time savings, and ROI.
 *   - Performance Monitoring: Employs OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
 *
 * Imports:
 *   - Job (Bull) for job type definitions.
 *   - trace (OpenTelemetry) for performance monitoring and tracing annotations.
 *   - AnalyticsService for AI-powered analytics (trackCampaignMetrics, getLeadAnalytics, generateROIReport).
 *   - { LEAD_CONVERSION_RATE, EMAIL_OPEN_RATE, ROI_RATIO } for referencing key business metrics.
 *   - QueueService for scheduling and processing recurring jobs in a robust manner.
 *
 * Globals:
 *   ROLLUP_INTERVALS: Cron expressions for HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY analytics runs.
 *
 * The code follows an enterprise-ready style with extensive comments, error handling, caching
 * checkpoints, partial failure management, and distributed instrumentation.

 * ----------------------
 * Enhanced job processor responsible for aggregating analytics data across the platform. Uses
 * improved error handling, caching, and performance instrumentation via OpenTelemetry. This function:
 *   1. Validates job data and parameters.
 *   2. Initializes the AnalyticsService with a retry or fallback mechanism.
 *   3. Checks for recent, already-computed data in the cache (placeholder).
 *   4. Processes campaign metrics with robust error handling.
 *   5. Aggregates lead analytics data using the analytics service.
 *   6. Generates ROI reports with data consistency checks.
 *   7. Potentially updates the cache or persistent store with new aggregated results.
 *   8. Records performance metrics, distributed traces, and relevant logs.
 *   9. Handles partial failures gracefully, with fallback or circuit breaker stubs.
 *   10. Implements cleanup or resource release logic (e.g., clearing buffers).

      revenueData: 45000,

    });
    console.info('ROI report generated:', roiReport);

    // 7. Update the cache with new aggregated results (placeholder)
    // If analyticsService.cacheService were properly instantiated, we could store:
    // await analyticsService.cacheService.set('analytics-rollup:latest', { leadAnalytics, roiReport });

    // 8. Record performance metrics and traces
    // Typically handled by instrumentation, but we can optionally add custom event logs
    console.info('processAnalyticsRollup: Completed rollup operations successfully.');

    // 9. Partial failure handling or fallback is used above in step #4 as an example

    // 10. Cleanup (release resources, flush buffers, close spans)
    // For demonstration, simply log. The span is ended in the finally block.

/**
 * scheduleRollupJobs
 * ------------------
 * Enhanced job scheduler function that sets up recurring rollups (hourly, daily, weekly) with
 * improved monitoring, concurrency configuration, backoff, graceful shutdown, and alerting.
 * This approach uses the provided QueueService to register repeating jobs and manage their
 * lifecycles. The steps represent enterprise-grade scheduling best practices:
 *   1. Initialize queue health checks to ensure readiness prior to scheduling.
 *   2. Configure job concurrency limits and memory constraints through Bull or job-level options.
 *   3. Set up an hourly rollup job with appropriate monitoring.
 *   4. Set up a daily rollup job with a backoff strategy.
 *   5. Configure a weekly rollup job with extended timeouts or special handling.
 *   6. Include stubs for graceful shutdown handlers if the system is halting (QueueService closeAll).
 *   7. Configure alert thresholds for high job failure rates or timeouts in repeated tasks.
 *   8. Implement job progress tracking as needed for large data sets.
 *   9. Initialize robust error recovery or re-queue mechanisms on partial failures.
 *   10. Configure resource cleanup, logging, or final notifications once scheduling is complete.
 *
 * @param queueService - An instance of the QueueService to schedule and manage jobs.
 * @returns Promise<void>

export async function scheduleRollupJobs(queueService: QueueService): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Initialize queue health checks (stub approach). In production, queueService may already
  //    have internal checks. If additional checks are required, they'd be performed here.
  //    e.g., verifying queueService is connected or retrieving metrics from the analytics-rollup queue.

  // 2. Configure concurrency & memory limits. For demonstration, we might set concurrency = 2
  //    inside processQueue or at job-level options. We'll do concurrency in processQueue below.
  const concurrencyLimit = 2;

  // 3. Set up hourly rollup. We'll define a repeating job that triggers every hour with monitoring.
  //    In real usage, we might pass job data or advanced options. Here we pass minimal data.
  await queueService.addJob('analytics-rollup', { skipIfCached: true }, {
    repeat: { cron: ROLLUP_INTERVALS.HOURLY },
    removeOnComplete: true,
    removeOnFail: false,
  });

  // 4. Set up daily rollup with a backoff strategy. This job might handle more comprehensive steps.
  //    We can define a higher number of attempts or a backoff pattern. For demonstration:
  await queueService.addJob('analytics-rollup', { dailyAggregate: true }, {
    repeat: { cron: ROLLUP_INTERVALS.DAILY },
    backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 60000 },
    attempts: 5,
    removeOnComplete: false,
    removeOnFail: false,
  });

  // 5. Set up weekly rollup with a longer timeout or advanced logic
  await queueService.addJob('analytics-rollup', { weeklySummary: true }, {
    repeat: { cron: ROLLUP_INTERVALS.WEEKLY },
    timeout: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30-minute timeout for potentially large data
    removeOnComplete: false,
  });

  // 6. Implement graceful shutdown handlers. Typically, we'd call queueService.closeAll in a
  //    service-level or application-level shutdown routine, but we can illustrate a stub:
  //    process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  //      console.info('scheduleRollupJobs: SIGTERM received. Closing queues...');
  //      await queueService.closeAll();
  //      process.exit(0);
  //    });

  // 7. Configure alerting thresholds or advanced watch. We might integrate with Slack or PagerDuty
  //    if too many rollup jobs fail consecutively. Implementation can be placed in queue events.

  // 8. Set up job progress tracking. The analytics job processor could call job.progress(percent).
  //    For demonstration, we rely on processAnalyticsRollup to handle partial steps.

  // 9. Initialize error recovery stubs. If repeated errors occur, we can re-queue or degrade gracefully.

  // 10. Resource cleanup stubs. Possibly purge old data or rotate logs once scheduling is complete.

  // Finally, attach the actual job processor. This is where concurrency is applied.
  await queueService.processQueue('analytics-rollup', processAnalyticsRollup, {
    concurrency: concurrencyLimit,
  });
