/***************************************************************************************************
 * File: campaign.model.ts
 * Description:
 *   Provides the "CampaignModel" class for managing Campaign data and operations within the B2B Sales
 *   Intelligence Platform. It integrates with Prisma via the PrismaClient, performs comprehensive
 *   validation with campaignSchema, leverages a CacheService for performance optimizations, and
 *   ensures robust error handling and logging. This class addresses:
 *     - CRUD actions for Campaign records
 *     - Security contexts for validating organization access
 *     - Input data sanitization and schema-based validation
 *     - Cache updates and invalidation
 *     - Metrics initialization and updates
 *
 * Dependencies & Imports:
 *   - PrismaClient (from @prisma/client ^5.0.0) for database operations
 *   - campaignSchema (from ../schemas/campaign.schema) for Zod-based validation
 *   - DatabaseService for obtaining Prisma client instances
 *   - Logger for structured logs
 *   - AppError for standardized error handling
 *   - CacheService for caching campaign data
 *
 * Exports:
 *   - CampaignModel class with methods:
 *       create(data: Campaign, organizationId: string): Promise<Campaign>
 *       findById(id: string, organizationId: string): Promise<Campaign | null>
 *       update(id: string, data: Partial<Campaign>, organizationId: string): Promise<Campaign>
 *       updateMetrics(id: string, metrics: CampaignMetrics, organizationId: string): Promise<Campaign>
