/**
 * This file provides a comprehensive, enterprise-grade definition of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
 * for the B2B Sales Intelligence and Engagement Platform. The code herein satisfies both the
 * requirement for strictly typed role definitions and the exhaustive permission mappings per role.
 *
 * It includes:
 *  1. USER_ROLES enumeration for the core roles in the system.
 *  2. Strongly typed permission scope, resource, and permission action types.
 *  3. RolePermissions interface that enforces structure and immutability for each roleâ€™s permissions.
 *  4. ROLE_PERMISSIONS constant object that assigns specific permission sets and rate limits
 *     to each role, ensuring adherence to the authorization model in a globally, organizationally,
 *     personally, or rate-limited scoped context.
 */
