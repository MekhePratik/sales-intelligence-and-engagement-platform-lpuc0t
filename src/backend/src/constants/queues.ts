/**
 * This file defines the queue name constants used for background job processing
 * with the Bull queue system (Bull v4.0.2) in conjunction with Redis. These queues
 * orchestrate the asynchronous tasks required by the B2B Sales Intelligence and
 * Engagement Platform described in the technical specifications. They address
 * multiple critical workflows, including:
 *
 * 1. Job Queue Management:
 *    - Central to our async processing strategy.
 *    - Managed by Bull + Redis, supporting multiple worker processes.
 *
 * 2. Email Automation:
 *    - Templates, scheduling, sequences, and A/B testing.
 *    - Enhances personalized outreach capabilities at scale.
 *
 * 3. Lead Management:
 *    - AI-powered enrichment for contact data.
 *    - Intelligent lead scoring and prioritization.
 *
 * 4. Analytics:
 *    - Aggregating metrics for campaign performance tracking and ROI calculations.
 *    - Leveraging real-time rollups for rich dashboards.
 *
 * Each exported constant is used as the identifier for a distinct queue,
 * ensuring clarity and maintainability across different subsystems.
