 * queue.service.ts
 *
 * This file defines the QueueService class, responsible for managing Bull job queues with
 * comprehensive capabilities, including:
 *  - Creating and configuring new queues using Redis connections
 *  - Adding jobs and handling advanced retry/deferral strategies
 *  - Setting up job processing with concurrency controls
 *  - Tracking and reporting queue metrics (completion rates, error rates, etc.)
 *  - Health monitoring through periodic checks of queue activity
 *  - Graceful shutdown of all queues, ensuring no job interruption
 *
 * Requirements Addressed:
 * 1. Job Queue (Bull + Redis): Async task processing with multiple worker processes
 * 2. Async Processing: Background jobs, prioritization, dead letter queues, rate limiting
 * 3. Email Automation: Queue handling for email sequences and A/B testing workflows
 * 4. Lead Management: Queue operations for enrichment, scoring, search index updates
 *
 * Imports:
 *  - { Queue, QueueOptions, Job } from 'bull' // bull@^4.10.0
 *  - createRedisClient from ../config/redis
 *  - logger (info, error, warn, debug) from ../utils/logger.util
 *  - Queue name constants: EMAIL_SEQUENCE_QUEUE, ANALYTICS_ROLLUP_QUEUE, DATA_ENRICHMENT_QUEUE,
 *    LEAD_SCORING_QUEUE, CACHE_WARMUP_QUEUE from ../constants/queues
 *
 * Export:
 *  - QueueService class implementing required methods with named exports
