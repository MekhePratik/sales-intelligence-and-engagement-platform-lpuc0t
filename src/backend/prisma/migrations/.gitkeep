# This .gitkeep file ensures the 'prisma/migrations' directory is tracked by Git
# even when no actual migration files are present. Maintaining this directory is
# critical for database schema management and version control, as outlined in:
#  - Technical Specification Sections:
#       (1) "2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE/2.2 Component Details/Core Components"
#           regarding Database Schema Management
#       (2) "5. SYSTEM DESIGN/5.2 DATABASE DESIGN/Storage Strategy"
#           regarding PostgreSQL database schema version control
#
# Purpose & Importance:
#  - Maintains consistent directory structure for Prisma migrations, enabling
#    collaborative database schema changes across teams.
#  - Preserves essential schema versioning history to support the project's Data
#    Storage Strategy and to align with enterprise-grade version control practices.
#  - Prevents accidental deletion of the migration directory, safeguarding the
#    foundation for change tracking and rollback procedures.
#
# Maintenance Requirements:
#  1. THIS FILE MUST REMAIN EMPTY: No code or migration files should be placed here.
#  2. MUST NOT BE DELETED under any circumstance (unless superseded by project-wide
#     repository reorganization).
#  3. ESSENTIAL FOR GIT: Without this placeholder, Git would ignore this directory
#     if empty, causing potential loss of migration history and schema changes.
#  4. CRITICAL FOR DATABASE SCHEMA VERSION CONTROL: Ensures all developers,
#     CI/CD pipelines, and staging/production environments maintain a reliable
#     structure for Prisma migrations.
#
# Usage Notes:
#  - Deployments and CI/CD pipelines rely on the existence of this folder to
#    properly locate and run new migration scripts.
#  - If you are checking in a new Prisma migration, it should reside in this
#    directory as a subfolder containing the appropriate migration files.
