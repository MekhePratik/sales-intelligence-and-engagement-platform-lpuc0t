    Define a linear gradient that transitions from the primary brand color (#2563eb) 
    to the secondary color (#64748b). This will be used to fill the circular background.

  <!-- 
    Render a circle with the defined gradient, forming the base shape of the logo. 
    The circle is centered at (16,16) with a radius of 14.50, 
    leaving a 1.50px margin from the SVG boundary (since the viewBox is 32x32).

  <!-- 
    Render a stylized shape in white (#fff) to maintain a 4.5:1 
    contrast ratio over the gradient background. This shape is purely illustrative 
    and can be replaced with an actual brand symbol or letter if needed.
    The coordinates are kept at two decimal places.
